    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>Challengr is the brain child of 4 visionaries from Web Application UK envisaged while competing in Hack Manchester 2015. Created by Ginteras Liksa, Seck Wei Lim, Matt Lennon and Adam Chappell in the hope of beating all other competition to the Lad Bible loot, have fun creating something new and hopefully creating something that other people could enjoy too.
        <br/><br/>
    The app is made with the intention to encourage people to become more involved in raising money for charitable causes in the local community through the use of social media integration you can challenge your friends to do something for charity. It could be getting them to bath in ice, it could be getting your friend to wear a dress to work, run that marathon they keep saying they're going to run or creating something totally unique and going viral. <br/><br/>
        So if you're feeling generous or just want to stitch your friends up, sign up for Challengr now! And if you cant decide which friend to stitch up, why not challenge them all!
